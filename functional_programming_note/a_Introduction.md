# Introduction

### 1. Categories
- Pure Functional Language
  - only support the functional paradigms
- Impure Functional Language
  - support the functional paradigms and imperative style programming
<br><br>

### 2. Characteristics
- concept of mathematical functions -> use conditional expressions and recursion 
- higher-order functions, lazy evaluation features
- not support flow controls (loop, conditional statements)
- support Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism (like OOP)
<br><br>

### 3. Advantage
- Bugs-Free Code (not support state)
- Efficient Parallel Programming (no mutable state, no state-change issues)
- Efficiency (independent units can run concurrently)
- Supports Nested Functions
- Lazy Evaluation (support Lazy Functional Constructs)
<br><br>

### 4. Disadvantage
- require larger memory (make new objects for every actions)
<br><br>

### 5. Compare with OOP
||Functional Programming|Object-oriented Programming|
|---|------|------|
|Data|Immutable|Mutable|
|Programming Model|Declarative|Imperative|
|Focus|What you are doing|How you are doing|
|Parallel Programming|Support|Not suitable|
|Side effects|Functions don't have|Methods can produce|
|Flow control|Using function calls, recursion|Using loops, conditional statements|
|Iterate Collection Data|Recursion concept|Loop concept|
|Execution order of statements|Not important|Very important|
|Support Abstraction|Abstraction over Data, Abstraction over Behavior|Abstraction over Data
